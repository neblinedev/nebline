## 2025-03-24 (Monday)

Woke up feeling like I hadn't slept at all, just tossed and turned with a vague sense of dread. The gray Seattle sky didn't help. Work felt impossible today. Stared at the same design brief for an hour, the words blurring together. My mind kept replaying a minor disagreement Mark and I had over the weekend about visiting his parents. Why does everything feel like a potential catastrophe? Ended up ordering pizza again because the thought of chopping vegetables felt monumental. Felt a wave of self-loathing for being so unproductive and unhealthy.

Therapy with Dr. Evans. We dug into my conflict avoidance. She pointed out how I often say 'yes' when I mean 'no' just to keep the peace, which builds resentment later. It's true. I agreed to help my sister, Lisa, with her move this weekend even though I feel completely overwhelmed already. Dr. Evans gave me some phrases to practice setting boundaries. Saying them out loud in the session felt awkward, almost rude. Can I actually do it in real life? Left feeling emotionally raw but also a tiny bit empowered.

The anxiety before the client presentation was almost paralyzing. My palms were sweating, heart racing. I practiced my part over and over, but when the time came, my voice trembled. I rushed through my slides, convinced I sounded like an idiot. My boss, David, gave me a noncommittal nod afterwards. I spent the rest of the day analyzing his expression, convinced he's planning to fire me. Ben tried to tell me I did fine, but I couldn't believe him. Needed to escape the office, so I left exactly at 5 PM.

Forced myself to pull out my paints tonight. Started working on a landscape inspired by that trip Mark and I took to the coast last year. Mixing the colors, the feel of the brush on canvas – it grounded me. For a couple of hours, the anxious chatter in my head quieted down. I lost track of time. It wasn't perfect, but it felt *mine*. Maybe Dr. Evans is right, maybe I *should* join that art group. The thought is terrifying, but also intriguing.

Date night with Mark. We went to that little Italian place we like. He was sweet, asked about my therapy session, listened patiently while I stumbled through explaining my anxieties about Lisa's move. But then he mentioned his parents again, and I felt that familiar tension rise. I managed to change the subject, but the underlying issue hangs there. Avoidance. Dr. Evans' words echoed in my head. Came home feeling disconnected, even though the evening was pleasant on the surface.

## 2025-03-29 (Saturday)

Felt completely drained today. Cancelled plans to meet Chloe for coffee, texting her a vague excuse about not feeling well. The guilt gnawed at me. Why push away people who care? Spent the day drifting around the apartment, tidying things that didn't need tidying, scrolling endlessly online. Mark was out running errands. The silence felt heavy. Watched some sad movie and cried, not even sure why. Just a general sense of melancholy.

Woke up determined to have a better day. Made a proper breakfast. Called Lisa and managed to set a boundary – told her I could help for a few hours on Saturday, but not the whole weekend. She sounded surprised but understanding. It felt like a huge victory! Spent the afternoon journaling and sketching. Planned out my work week, trying to break tasks into smaller, less daunting steps. Feeling cautiously optimistic. Maybe this week will be different.
