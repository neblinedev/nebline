# Journal - Week 2025-CW-14

## 2025-03-31 (Monday)

Woke up with that familiar knot of anxiety in my stomach. It felt like a physical weight pressing down on me. The design project for the new client feels impossible. Every idea I sketch seems childish or derivative. Mark (my husband) tried to reassure me this morning, but his words felt hollow. How can he understand this constant self-doubt? Spent most of the afternoon staring at a blank screen, feeling the deadline loom closer. Ordered takeout because cooking felt like too much effort. The guilt about not being productive is almost as bad as the anxiety itself.

Therapy session with Dr. Evans. We talked about the 'imposter syndrome' I feel at work. She suggested I try listing my accomplishments, no matter how small. It sounds simple, but even thinking about it makes me uncomfortable, like I'm bragging or lying. Later, I forced myself to go for a walk. The park was nice, crisp air, but I kept comparing myself to the joggers who looked so effortlessly fit and happy. Came home feeling slightly better physically, but mentally still tangled. Mark suggested watching a movie, but I just wanted to be alone.

Team meeting today was torture. My heart pounded the whole time. Sarah presented her concepts, and they were brilliant. So polished. I felt a pang of jealousy mixed with admiration. When my turn came, I mumbled something about needing more time. My boss looked slightly annoyed. I spent the rest of the day convinced everyone thinks I'm incompetent. Avoided eye contact in the hallway. Came home and immediately started cleaning obsessively â€“ my go-to coping mechanism when I feel out of control.

A small breakthrough! I finally got an idea for the client project that doesn't feel completely terrible. Sketched it out quickly before the self-doubt could creep back in. Showed it to my colleague, Ben, and he actually liked it. Said it was "fresh." That little bit of validation felt like sunshine after weeks of rain. It didn't erase the anxiety, but it lessened its grip for a few hours. Maybe I'm not a total failure after all? Celebrated by actually cooking dinner tonight.

Met up with Chloe and Jess after work. Chloe is going through a rough patch with her partner, and it was good to focus on supporting her instead of dwelling on my own issues. Jess is always so bubbly; her energy is infectious, though sometimes exhausting. I managed to stay present for most of the conversation, only zoning out a couple of times thinking about work. It felt good to connect, to remember I have people who care. Still, the social battery drained quickly. Came home feeling tired but less lonely.

Woke up late. The exhaustion from the week hit me hard. Spent the morning reading in bed. Mark wanted to go hiking, but I just couldn't muster the energy. Felt guilty saying no, saw the disappointment on his face. Why can't I just be normal and enjoy things? Tried painting in the afternoon, but felt uninspired. Ended up scrolling through social media, comparing my messy life to everyone else's curated perfection. A recipe for feeling worse.

## 2025-04-06 (Sunday)

Tried to be productive today. Meal prepped, tidied the apartment, answered emails. Felt a sense of accomplishment, but also a lingering dread about the week ahead. Will the good feeling from Thursday last? Or will the anxiety monster rear its ugly head again? Journaling helps untangle these thoughts. Writing it down makes it feel slightly more manageable. Trying to focus on the small steps, the tiny victories. One day at a time.
