# Journal - Week 2025-CW-15

## 2025-04-07 (Monday)

The week started with a familiar sense of dread. The positive momentum from last week feels like a distant memory. Had a minor panic attack this morning just thinking about the client feedback due today. Managed to calm down using the breathing techniques Dr. Evans taught me, but it left me feeling shaky and drained. The feedback was actually mostly positive, with a few minor revisions requested. Logically, I know this is good, but my anxiety whispers that they secretly hate it. Mark tried to celebrate the good feedback with me, but I just couldn't muster enthusiasm.

Nice

Therapy session. Talked about my reaction to the client feedback and the persistent feeling of not being good enough. Dr. Evans suggested I challenge the negative thoughts by writing down evidence to the contrary. It feels forced, like I'm trying to trick myself, but I promised I'd try. Spent the afternoon working on the revisions. Felt slightly more focused than yesterday, but still hyper-aware of every potential flaw.

Received an email invitation to a networking event for local designers next week. My immediate reaction was 'NO.' The thought of making small talk with strangers, potentially successful designers, is terrifying. What would I even say? But a small part of me knows I *should* go, that hiding away isn't helping. Mark encouraged me to sign up, saying it could be good for me. I haven't decided yet. The internal debate is exhausting.

Felt irritable and on edge all day. Snapped at Ben again over something trivial. Apologized immediately this time, but still felt awful. Why am I like this? He was understanding, but I hate being that person. Tried painting tonight to unwind, but just ended up making a mess. Felt frustrated and talentless. Mark suggested a walk, but I declined. Just wanted to crawl into bed and disappear.

Finished the client revisions and sent them off. Felt a brief sense of relief, quickly followed by the anxiety of waiting for the *final* final approval. Chloe called, wanting to vent about her ongoing relationship drama. Listened patiently, offered support, but felt drained afterwards. It's hard balancing being a good friend with protecting my own fragile energy levels. Decided against the networking event. The relief was immediate, but tinged with guilt.

Woke up feeling sluggish. Mark had planned a day trip to explore a nearby town, but I just couldn't face it. Felt immense guilt seeing his disappointment. Why can't I just be easygoing? Spent the day reading and tidying. Tried the 'evidence log' Dr. Evans suggested. Wrote down 'Client liked initial concepts' and 'Finished revisions on time'. It felt silly, but maybe it's planting a seed? Had a quiet dinner with Mark. Tried to explain my lack of energy. He was kind, but I still feel like a burden.

## 2025-04-13 (Sunday)

A slightly better day. Woke up without immediate dread. Went for a long walk by myself, listening to music. The sun was out, which helped lift my mood slightly. Came back and did some sketching for my personal project â€“ the one about visualizing anxiety. It felt meaningful. Had a calm conversation with Mark, apologizing for yesterday. He reassured me it was okay. Prepared for the week ahead, feeling apprehensive but a little more grounded than last Sunday.
