# Journal - Week 2025-CW-16

## 2025-04-14 (Monday)

Client approved the final revisions! Huge relief. David even gave me a rare "Nice job, Alex." Should feel elated, right? Instead, I just feel... empty. Like I've run a marathon and now there's nothing. The anxiety about *what's next* is already creeping in. Spent the afternoon trying to organize my files, feeling restless and unfocused. Mark suggested celebrating tonight, but I feel too drained. Maybe tomorrow.

Therapy session. Talked about the post-project emptiness and the fear of inactivity. Dr. Evans called it the 'anxiety paradox' – stressed when busy, anxious when not. We discussed structuring my downtime, maybe finally joining that art group I keep thinking about. The idea is still intimidating. What if they're all way more talented? What if I don't fit in? Later, I actually looked up the group's meeting times online. Baby steps.

A slower day at work. Started researching ideas for a small internal project David mentioned. Felt good to have something low-stakes to focus on. Had lunch with Ben. He asked if I was okay, said I seemed stressed lately. I admitted I'd been struggling a bit. He was surprisingly kind, shared that his wife deals with anxiety too. It felt good to connect, to feel less alone in the office environment.

Felt a surge of creative energy today. Spent a few hours working on my personal 'anxiety art' project. Tried a new technique with watercolors, letting the colors bleed and blend in unexpected ways. It felt freeing, less controlled than my usual design work. Mark peeked in and said it looked "really interesting." His genuine curiosity felt encouraging. Maybe I *can* create things just for myself.

Jess called, excited about her job offer – she got it! Felt genuinely happy for her. We made plans to celebrate next week. It's nice to have social plans to look forward to, even if they also spark a little anxiety. Mark and I had a quiet night in, watched a documentary. Felt comfortable, connected. Less tension than a few weeks ago. Maybe talking things through, even when it's hard, does help.

## 2025-04-19 (Saturday)

Woke up feeling motivated. Cleaned the apartment, went grocery shopping, even went for a run. Felt productive, capable. In the afternoon, I actually emailed the art group coordinator, asking about joining. My heart pounded as I hit send. What if they reject me? What if it's awkward? Tried to push the negative thoughts away. Mark was proud of me for taking the step. His support makes a huge difference.

## 2025-04-20 (Sunday)

A calm Sunday. Read the paper, drank coffee, listened to music. Felt a sense of peace I haven't felt in a while. Journaling tonight feels lighter. The anxiety is still present, a low hum in the background, but it doesn't feel all-consuming. Maybe this is progress? Maybe this is what 'managing' anxiety looks like – not its absence, but learning to live alongside it. Feeling cautiously hopeful for the week ahead.
