# Journal - Week 2025-CW-09

## 2025-02-24 (Monday)

Nice.

Woke up feeling heavy, like the weekend didn't happen. The apartment felt too quiet. Mark left early for a work trip. Stared at my reflection while brushing my teeth and just saw tired eyes looking back. Work felt like wading through mud. Couldn't focus on the design revisions David asked for. My mind kept drifting to Mark being away – irrational fears about his plane, feeling lonely already. Ordered takeout, couldn't face the grocery store. Felt pathetic.

The design revisions are still mocking me. Every time I try to work on them, my inner critic screams that it's not good enough, that David will hate it. Spent way too long scrolling through design blogs, comparing my work to others and feeling inadequate. Had a brief, stilted call with Mark. He sounded busy, distracted. Hung up feeling even more disconnected. Forced myself to eat a proper meal tonight, but it tasted like cardboard.

Team meeting. Sarah presented her latest work, and it was stunning, as usual. Felt that familiar mix of admiration and intense jealousy. Why can't I be that confident, that talented? I stayed silent when David asked for input on a new project brief. The words wouldn't come out. Felt like a fraud sitting there. Came home and stress-cleaned the kitchen until it gleamed. At least I can control _something_.

Pulled out my paints tonight, desperate for an escape. Tried working on that abstract piece reflecting my anxiety, but the colors felt wrong, muddy. Ended up scraping the paint off the canvas in frustration. Felt like a failure even in my own hobby. Talked to my sister Lisa on the phone. She complained about her job, her boyfriend. I listened, offered advice, but felt completely empty afterwards. Why is it easier to solve other people's problems than my own?

Mark came home tonight. Felt a huge wave of relief wash over me when he walked through the door. We ordered pizza and watched a movie. It felt normal, comfortable. But I couldn't shake the feeling of dread about the weekend. He wants to go hiking tomorrow, talk about 'us'. I'm scared of what he might say, scared of disappointing him. Easier to pretend everything is fine.

The hike. It was beautiful, crisp mountain air, stunning views. But the conversation was tense. Mark gently brought up how distant I've been, how worried he is. I tried to explain the anxiety, the depression, but it felt like speaking a foreign language. He listened, held my hand, said he loved me. But I saw the confusion in his eyes. How can he understand this darkness if I barely understand it myself? Came home feeling emotionally exhausted, a gulf between us.

Woke up feeling fragile. Mark was quiet this morning, giving me space. Spent the day in a haze. Did laundry, paid bills – mundane tasks to avoid thinking. Journaling tonight feels heavy. The conversation yesterday opened a door I usually keep firmly shut. It's terrifying to be vulnerable, to admit how much I'm struggling. But maybe it's necessary? Trying to hold onto the fact that he didn't run away. He's still here. That has to count for something.
