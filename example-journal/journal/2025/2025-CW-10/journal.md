# Journal - Week 2025-CW-10

## 2025-03-03 (Monday)

The weight feels heavier this week. A new project kicked off, and the client seems demanding. My inbox is overflowing. Felt overwhelmed from the moment I sat down at my desk. That familiar tightness in my chest returned. Took a walk at lunch, but just ended up ruminating about everything I *should* be doing. Came back feeling more stressed than before. Mark asked about my day, and I just shrugged. Couldn't find the words to explain the chaos in my head.

Therapy felt crucial today. Talked to Dr. Evans about the new project and my fear of failing to meet the client's expectations. She reminded me about breaking tasks down, focusing on one thing at a time. We also practiced a grounding technique – focusing on my senses when anxiety spikes. It helped in the session, but the real test is using it 'in the wild'. Left feeling a bit more equipped, but still apprehensive.

Managed to get through the day by focusing intensely on one task at a time, like Dr. Evans suggested. It actually worked, sort of. I made progress on the initial concepts for the new client. But the effort required was immense. Felt completely drained by 5 PM. Ben invited me for after-work drinks with the team, but I declined. The thought of making small talk felt unbearable. Need quiet. Need to recharge.

A slower day, thankfully. Caught up on emails and admin tasks. Found myself reading articles about anxiety and graphic design online – procrastination disguised as research? Maybe. It's comforting, in a weird way, to know others struggle with similar things. Spent the evening curled up with a book and tea. Mark was working late. The quiet apartment felt peaceful tonight, not lonely.

Pushed myself to go out with Chloe and Jess tonight. We went to a tapas place. It was loud, crowded – my anxiety flared up initially. But Chloe made me laugh recounting a disastrous date she went on, and Jess was excited about a potential job offer. Focusing on them helped. I even shared a bit about the new stressful client. They listened without judgment. It felt good. Maybe I don't need to hide my struggles quite so much. Came home feeling tired but socially fulfilled.

Woke up feeling the effects of last night – not hungover, just socially drained. Allowed myself a lazy morning. Mark suggested we visit that new art gallery downtown, and surprisingly, I agreed. It was actually inspiring. Saw some beautiful abstract pieces that sparked ideas for my personal project. It felt good to engage with art purely for pleasure, not for work. A reminder of why I love design in the first place.

## 2025-03-09 (Sunday)

Productive Sunday. Grocery shopping, laundry, meal prep. The usual routine helps anchor me before the week begins. Spent some time journaling, reflecting on the week. The anxiety is still there, a constant companion, but maybe I'm getting slightly better at navigating it? Or maybe that's just wishful thinking. Trying to focus on the progress, not perfection. Prepared my work bag, laid out clothes. Ready, or as ready as I can be.
