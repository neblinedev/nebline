# Journal - Week 2025-CW-11

## 2025-03-10 (Monday)

Woke up with a jolt at 4 AM, heart pounding. Couldn't get back to sleep, just lay there worrying about the presentation on Wednesday and the feedback from the branding project. Dragged myself out of bed feeling exhausted before the day even started. Work was a blur of trying to look busy while my brain felt like scrambled eggs. Snapped at Ben when he asked a simple question about a font. Felt terrible afterwards, but couldn't bring myself to apologize properly. Just mumbled something and escaped to my desk.

Managed to pull together the presentation slides, fueled by caffeine and sheer panic. They look okay, I guess? But the thought of standing up in front of the client team makes me feel physically ill. Mark tried to help me practice tonight, but I got defensive and shut him down. Why do I push away help when I need it most? Ended up working late, tweaking minor details that probably don't even matter. Avoidance tactics.

Presentation day. Felt nauseous all morning. The actual presentation was a blur. I remember my voice shaking, my hands feeling clammy. I think I answered their questions coherently, but honestly, I blacked out a little. The clients seemed pleased, or at least polite. David gave me another one of his inscrutable nods. The relief afterwards was immense, but quickly replaced by exhaustion and the lingering fear that I'd messed up somehow. Came home and collapsed on the sofa.

Feeling the post-presentation slump. Low energy, low motivation. Spent most of the day on easy tasks, avoiding anything too demanding. Read through some old journal entries tonight. It's strange seeing the same patterns repeat â€“ the anxiety spikes, the self-doubt, the brief moments of relief. Am I making any real progress? Or just running in circles? Felt a wave of hopelessness wash over me. Tried to counter it by listing three things I'm grateful for, as Dr. Evans suggested. It felt forced.

Met Jess for coffee after work. Her relentless optimism is sometimes grating, but today it was actually kind of nice. She talked about her new pottery class, her upcoming trip. It was a welcome distraction from my own internal monologue. I even managed to share a little about how stressed I've been, and she was surprisingly understanding. Maybe I misjudge her sometimes. Came home feeling lighter. Mark had cooked dinner, which was a lovely surprise.

## 2025-03-15 (Saturday)

A gloriously unproductive day. Slept in late. Stayed in my pajamas until noon. Read a novel, watched a silly reality TV show. Mark and I went for a walk by the water in the afternoon. Didn't talk much, just enjoyed the quiet companionship. It felt good to just *be*, without the pressure to achieve anything. Allowed myself to simply rest. These days feel rare and precious.

## 2025-03-16 (Sunday)

Felt recharged after yesterday's rest. Tackled some chores, planned meals for the week. Even did a bit of sketching for that personal project I keep putting off. Felt a flicker of creative spark. Journaling tonight feels calmer than usual. Maybe rest is the key? Or maybe it's just the ebb and flow of this condition. Trying not to overthink it and just appreciate the moment of peace.
