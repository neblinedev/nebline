## 2025-03-17 (Monday)

St. Patrick's Day. Woke up feeling surprisingly okay. Maybe it was the sunshine finally breaking through the clouds. Went for a run before work, the cold air felt good. Managed to tackle a tricky part of the branding project I'd been avoiding. Felt a sense of accomplishment, a rare feeling lately. Mark suggested going out for a green beer later, but the thought of crowded pubs filled me with dread. Opted for a quiet night in instead. Progress, maybe?

Had that difficult conversation with Chloe today. She's been distant lately, and I finally asked her about it. Turns out she felt hurt that I cancelled on her last weekend. I tried to explain my anxiety without sounding like I was making excuses. It was awkward and uncomfortable, tears were shed (mostly mine). But we ended the conversation with a hug and a promise to be more open with each other. It was draining, but necessary. Relationships are hard work, especially when your brain is working against you.

The pressure is definitely on at work. Two deadlines looming. Felt that familiar wave of panic rising this afternoon. My chest tightened, thoughts started racing â€“ *what if I can't finish? What if it's not good enough?* Had to step away from my desk and do some breathing exercises in the restroom. It helped slightly, but the underlying stress is still there, humming beneath the surface. Snapped at Mark when he asked what was for dinner. Felt instantly guilty.

Picked up that mindfulness book again tonight. Read a chapter about accepting difficult thoughts without judgment. Easier said than done. My mind constantly wants to label things as 'good' or 'bad', 'success' or 'failure'. Tried a guided meditation before bed. Fell asleep halfway through, which I guess is better than lying awake worrying. Small steps.

Finished the branding project! Sent it off to the client feeling a mix of relief and terror. David actually stopped by my desk and said "Good work, Alex." Three simple words, but they meant a lot. Tried to savor the feeling, but the self-doubt whispered, *'He probably says that to everyone.'* Mark suggested celebrating, so we ordered fancy sushi. It was nice, but I couldn't fully relax, already worrying about the next project.

## 2025-03-22 (Saturday)

Spent the day with my parents. They came down from Vancouver for the weekend. It was... okay. Mom fussed over me, asking if I was eating enough, sleeping enough. Dad mostly talked about his golf game. I love them, but sometimes their visits feel more stressful than relaxing. Felt exhausted by the time they left. Mark was great, though, running interference and keeping the conversation light. Grateful for him.

## 2025-03-23 (Sunday)

Felt the Sunday Scaries creeping in this afternoon. Tried to combat them by planning the week ahead, making lists, tidying the apartment. It helps create a sense of order when my mind feels chaotic. Journaling about the visit with my parents helped process some of the mixed emotions. Realized I put a lot of pressure on myself to be the 'perfect daughter' around them. Need to work on letting that go.
