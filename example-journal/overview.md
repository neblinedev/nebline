## Who am I?
My name is Alex Morgan. I'm 35 years old, female, married, living in Seattle. I work as a graphic designer and have been in the field for over a decade. I grew up in Toronto, Canada, and moved west to Vancouver in my late twenties before settling in Seattle a few years ago.

## History

I’ve always been a creative soul, passionate about art and design since childhood. However, my journey hasn’t been without challenges. In my early twenties, I struggled with bouts of anxiety and depression that made it difficult to maintain steady work and relationships. Moving across cities was both an escape and a fresh start, but the underlying feelings often followed me.

I remember one winter in Vancouver when the gray skies seemed to mirror my mood. I would spend days indoors, avoiding social contact, feeling overwhelmed by even the smallest tasks. It was during this time that I started journaling, trying to make sense of my thoughts and emotions.

## Recurring issues

- Persistent anxiety, especially in social situations and at work.
- Periods of low motivation and self-doubt.
- Difficulty setting boundaries, leading to burnout.
- Occasional insomnia that disrupts my creative flow.

## My weaknesses

- I tend to overthink and ruminate on past mistakes.
- I can be overly self-critical, which sometimes paralyzes my creativity.
- Struggle with asking for help even when I need it.
- Sometimes isolate myself when feeling overwhelmed.

## My strengths

- Deeply empathetic and a good listener.
- Strong creative vision and attention to detail.
- Resilient and committed to personal growth despite setbacks.
- Ability to find beauty and inspiration in everyday life.

## What do I want to change or accomplish this year, to feel like I have reasons to celebrate the NYE?

This year, I want to focus on building healthier habits around work and self-care. I aim to complete a personal art project that reflects my journey with mental health. I also want to improve my social connections by being more open and present with friends and family.

My plan:
- Set aside dedicated time each week for creative work.
- Practice mindfulness and journaling daily to manage anxiety.
- Reach out to a therapist and attend regular sessions.
- Join a local art group to connect with like-minded people.
- Prioritize sleep hygiene to improve overall well-being.
